# Fools Work

## A Meeting Place of the Minds

And of those who've left their's behind, to finally take a a stand against the injustices and justices deemed redundant or subjectively disagreeable which we face on a sporadic basis throughout our lives. __Today__, on this day of _April the 2nd in the year 2021 CE_, we plant our flag in the ground and our feet on our shoes, prepared to air our grievances to any and all who would listen and to those caught unawares of our impromptu pronoucements.

And to those who would chide us on starting a day late we say: yes one day behind deadline, but only temporally. And some would argue this a feature not a bug. For if we had made the deadline it would have been a "promptu" pronouncement, a word so boring they didn't even put it in the dictionary.

So enter our the halls of our museum of anguish and see for yourselves the urgency of our mission and our list of demands we demand be met. Isolated we are less than, but united  we are ~~Legion~~, ~~Legionairres~~, ~~Legend~~, Legumes - in that we can cause allergic reactions to certain predisposed individuals... Listen this book is just beginning. A Magikarp today, but a burden to all those who carry his weight for far too long... Yes we are the __Foolish__. Now enter ye who can withstand the grating of our shrills.
